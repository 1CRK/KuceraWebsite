                SABC is a student run club founded and run by myself (Christoper Kucera) and Alexander Azar. Our mission is to provide our school with a very active student run community service organization for students focused on improving the health of the world. We sponsor around three bake sales per quarter, donating all proceeds to  organizations focused on combating brain cancer in various ways. Outside of fundraising, our club is  extremely active in community service, participating in or running at least one event per quarter. We also sponsor a quartly speaker series through which we seek to both connect Lab students to cancer experts and help Lab students better understand the challenges those with cancer face.
