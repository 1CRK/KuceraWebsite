                Hi! My name is, as you may have guessed by the large font at the top of this page, Christopher Kucera. I am currently a student at the University of Chicago Lab School, class of 2017. In the making of this website, I hope to demonstrate some of my skills (or lack thereof) as well as provide an online platform for Students Against Brain Cancer, a student-run organization I co-founded.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am passionate about economics, physics, mathematics and political science. As a junior, I persued these dicsiplines as being one of only six juniors to take economics (one of only three to take both economics and AT US history), also taking AT Physics I. My senior year I plan to take inroductory economics as well as policial sicence at the University of Chicago while also taking AT Physics II, Statistics, English 3/4 and AP Calculus BC. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of school I am involved in many student activities and sports. Freshman, sophomore, and junior year I've been a varsity member of Lab's golf team. Sophomre and junior years I've been a varsity member of my school's track team.  I am currently president of two student organizations, Challenge Sucess and <a href="aboutSABC.html">Students Against Brain Cnacer</a>. I joined Challenge Sucess (a group that is focused around decreasing student stress) my junior year, and have helped the group in our endeavors to increase knowledge about stress levels and what students can do to mitigate their stress. Students Against Brain Cancer, a club that I founded with a friend, is a community service organization that participates in volunteer events as well as organizes fundraising events. More information can be found on the page I creatd for the club (linked above). Freshman and sophomore years I was also increadibly active in MUN, allowing me to branch out my interest in political science and learn more about how the world interacts. Unfortunately junior year I've not had enough time to thrive in the activity as I once did, but I plan to continue debate like activity in college, wherever I go to school.

                    <br>
                    Outside of the classroom and traditional extra-curriculars, I am passionate about my fitness as well as the Green Bay Packers. I love watching the team play and examining why specific players are sucessful in the ways they are. In my free time I read studies about economics and public policy concepts, watch football, exercise and play video games (in no particular order).
